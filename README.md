Tables with digested data from the Dutch national groundwater database dino

On https://www.dinoloket.nl/ over 80.000 groundwater heads series from the Netherlands are available. This repository contains tables with digested data from this database to help users find specific groundwater heads series more easliy. Data are updated once or twice a year, as creating these tables requires downloading data from dinoloket manually.

At this moment two tables are available:

filprops.csv :  
coordinates and number of measurement years of over 80.000 ground water heads series

locprops.csv :  
data from filprops aggregated to location level
