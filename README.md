Tables with digested data from the Dutch national groundwater database dino

More than 80.000 groundwater head series from the Netherlands are available on https://www.dinoloket.nl/. This repository presents tables with digested data from this database to help users find specific groundwater head series more easily. Files are updated once or twice a year, as creating these tables requires downloading data from dinoloket manually.

At this moment two tables are available:

filprops.csv :  
coordinates and number of measurement years of over 80.000 ground water heads series

locprops.csv :  
data from filprops aggregated to location level
